                                    <p>This project demonstrates a ransomware-like file encryption and decryption process using the cryptography.fernet library in Python. The script recursively encrypts all files in a specified directory (creds folder inside the user's home directory) and stores a ransom note, warning the victim about the encryption.</p>
                                    <p>The generated encryption key is sent to a Discord webhook along with system details such as IP address, MAC address, and hostname. The decryption script allows users to enter the correct encryption key to recover their files, removing the ransom note upon successful decryption.</p>

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying URLs as either "Benign" (safe) or "Malicious" (potentially harmful, e.g., phishing, malware). The analysis utilizes a dataset containing various features extracted from URLs, WHOIS registration information, and associated network traffic characteristics. The primary goal demonstrated in the provided script is to meticulously clean and explore this dataset to prepare it for subsequent model training and evaluation.

We had to learn HTML and CSS from scratch as we did not have any prior knowlege of making website before this. We also only had less than 24 hours and we was not able to sleep as we had unfinished tasks.</p>
                                    <p>Overall, this website/application had features to make the lives of deaf and blind people better. Features like a text to speech feature and also a ASL sign language interpreter.</p>

Although one feature was not working at the time, I still considered it a win for us because within the span of 24 hours, Wemanaged to learn HTML, CSS and machine leaning with python.</p>

                                    <p>This season taught me so much about the tools and techniques needed to effectively pen-test machines. Hack The Box continues to be a fantastic platform for sharpening my penetration testing skills and diving deep into real-world cybersecurity scenarios. This season challenged my limits and enriched my knowledge of vulnerability exploitation, network security, and threat hunting. I worked with a range of tools, from using netexec to perform RID brute-forcing on an SMB service (a technique for enumerating user accounts on a Windows system) to exploring local privilege escalation techniques using known CVEs. Whether it's dissecting complex networks or uncovering hidden vulnerabilities, each box presents a new challenge and an opportunity to grow.</p>

                                    <p>A significant challenge at the start was that i did not have prior experience to this season. I was new to hacking and I did not know the tools and techniques when facing an Active Directory or just a normal linux machine with a website. Getting to understand different services was hard at the start as all the terms was new to me. but I slowly practiced my skills on retired machines and watched walkthroughs on machines by Ippsec which helped me get the hang of the machines.</p>

                                    <h3>Results & Impact</h3>
                                    <p>At the end, i managed to pwn most of the easy machines as it was moslty straight forward. However i was still not able to gain foothold of the medium machines as my skills and expertice is not yet in that level. I really enjoyed hacking these "real-world" machines and I hope to continue hacking in the coming future.</p>
